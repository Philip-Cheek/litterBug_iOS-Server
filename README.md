# litterBug_iOS-Server
A project that I'm working on that will demonstrate many-to-one real currency transactions among other things. Uses iOS as client and Node as restful API. 

NOTE: Since I may end up deploying this project, I'm retaining the copyright to all code and assets for now. I'm sharing this project for demonstrative purposes largely.

But if you stumble across this project and happen to be working on something that presents challenges to which litterBug source code may help, feel free to shoot me a message if you'd like to incorporate a snippet from this project with your own. Or vice versa!
